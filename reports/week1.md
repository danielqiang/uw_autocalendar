**Team Report**



*   Copy of the third section from last week:
    *   N/A

*   Progress and issues: 
    *   The group met to write the requirements document
    *   Our group zoom meetings were fairly productive and we were able to get ideas from multiple people when defining the requirements and thinking about some of the early design decisions that we are going to have to make
    *   We learned that we did not have as much time as we thought when we were creating a rough schedule for our project and had to move some of our main features to stretch features in order to accommodate this
    *   We have not had too much trouble with these early tasks especially since we haven’t been faced with any implementation roadblocks, but within this next week our research may reveal problems that we have to solve in our design before we go ahead with the implementation

*   Plans and goals for the following week:
    *   Research tools/frameworks necessary for implementation: (1 week)
        *   Team: (3 days)
            *   OAuth 2.0 flow for Google Calendar
            *   Chrome extension setup
            *   Javascript familiarization
        *   Benjamin, Ariel: (3 days)
            *   Using the Canvas API via user credentials instead of API key
        *   Laksh, Daniel: (3 days)
            *   Gradescope authentication and API

**Contributions of individual team members.**



*   **The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.**
    *   N/A
*   **The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.**
    *   Xiaoyue Sun:
        * This is the first week that we worked as a team with ambition to develop a Google extension bringing convenience for calendar synchronization. This week, I met several times with the team to draft the requirement document together, and we finished the writing smoothly. In this process, I got to know each of the team members and had a better understanding of the project scope and expectation. According to our discussions, I would mainly take charge of frontend development in HTML/Javascript. Even though I am familiar with neither the frontend related work nor the languages, with all of those high-level ideas in mind, I am able to do targeted research and study on frontend design theories as well as language usages without feeling overwhelmed. It’s a learning week for me. All the resources I read are understandable, so I have not been stuck so far.

*   Ariel Shurygin

       *  I worked with the team to plan the high level layout of the team, splitting us into three different subteams. I learned how to best communicate with each member of the team and what type of languages and systems each team member is comfortable with. I had trouble with not immediately jumping into technical details and taking time on the important early planning steps such as architecture and arranging development style. I worked on this by reminding myself to slow down and attempting to speak less than I normally do in the meetings to think more before rushing forward as well as give my teammates more chances to give input.

*   Benjamin Lowry

    * This week our group met together to accomplish most of our tasks but I was involved in giving ideas for various portions of our requirements document and also asking questions and analyzing some of our early stage design ideas for our plugin. I learned that I think our group has a good breadth of knowledge and thus will be able to leverage different perspectives throughout the project. I think one thing I should improve is helping the team communications in our discussion channels to make sure we are all on the same page of when we are meeting and what our responsibilities for the week are.

*   Laksh Gupta

    * Our group met a couple of times this week to plan the outline for the project, figure out some basic milestones and divide the group into sub-teams. I got to learn a lot about my team-mates including the languages they are familiar coding in. I also contributed by adding to the discussions and giving suggestions for the software tools we could use going forward. After we divided all the members into sub-teams, I am working with Daniel on the Google Calendar side of the project researching the APIs and figuring out how to integrate them.

*   Daniel Qiang 
    
    * This was the first week we worked together to start any kind of planning/implementation for the project, including mapping out basic milestones and figuring out what people would be working on throughout the quarter. I learned about what other team members felt comfortable working on and also learned about OAuth via writing a Python script that pulls data from Canvas using SAML SSO authentication and writes to Google calendar via SAML SSO. Throughout this quarter, I will be working primarily with Laksh on researching the Google calendar API/setting up an interface to easily push events to a user’s Google calendar within a Javascript web app. My main difficulties this week involved trying to get OAuth to work for the Python prototype, though since it is the first week there were not really any serious blockers/difficulties.
*   **The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.**
