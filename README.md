# UW AutoCalendar

**UW AutoCalendar** is a Chrome add-on that offers one-click course schedule integration with Google Calendar (referencing Canvas/Gradescope websites). The service will help students automatically keep their Google Calendars up to date with class schedules and deadlines (assignments, lectures/sections, exams, zoom links, etc.). Our target audience will be students currently enrolled at UW.

## Repo Layout

Our main source code will be in the [src](src/) directory. The [public](public/) directory will (probably) contain boilerplate necessary for hooking our JavaScript source into Chrome as an add-on.
